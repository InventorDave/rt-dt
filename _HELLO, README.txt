You may peruse the source files at your own leisure. The engine itself, the "raytracer", is fully functioning. Should you feed an appropriate scene into the renderer, it does illumination, shading & shadows, reflection, refraction, and materials, including patterns and spherical/planar/cube mapping of PPM-based images.

The file you want to run the app is "raytracer.html".
