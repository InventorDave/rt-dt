# js-raytracer-challenge
Javascript implementation of Jamis Buck's Raytracer Challenge.

There are 3 .obj files. Try them out by loading "raytracer.html" and selecting an .obj file by clicking "Choose file". 
Then click "render obj!" AFTER you see the file contents loaded into the (resizable) text box. 
Or, download a custom .obj file, but it does not yet support textures or texture normals or vertice normals, or groups, 
so they are ignored. Just the 'face' and associated 'vertice' data is parsed.

Quite fast, though...
